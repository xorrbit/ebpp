Evil Bob's Pocket Painter
=========================

One of my first open source programs, and probably my first non-trivial coding project. This was released on September 23rd, 2001, when I was 14.

Check out the hilarious [readme.txt](readme.txt), or the cringe-worthy main entry point in [ebpp.c](ebpp.c).

Also interesting in [the changeset from 0.1 to 0.2](https://github.com/xorrbit/ebpp/commit/3b5e6176673a47e77ea0d29dfb90027926062494).

This brings back so many memories. Enjoy.
