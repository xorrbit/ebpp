Evil Bob's Pocket Painter
=========================

One of my first open source programs, and probably my first non-trivial coding project. This was released on September 23rd, 2001, when I was 14.

Check out the hilarious [readme.txt](readme.txt), or the cringe-worthy main entry point in [ebpp.c](ebpp.c).

This brings back so many memories. Enjoy.
